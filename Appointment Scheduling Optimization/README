We will build a simple scheduling system using ASP.NET Core MVC. This system will:

1. Schedule patients to available doctor time slots.
2. Optimize scheduling to minimize patient waiting time and maximize doctor availability.
3. Demonstrate basic time complexity considerations in the algorithm.

Step 1: Create a Visual Studio Project
1. Open Visual Studio:
   • Go to File > New > Project.

2. Select ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller):
  • Choose .NET 6 or later.
  • Name the project: SchedulingSystem.
  • Choose a folder and click Create.










•	Concept: Scheduling, Time Complexity
•	Description: Given a list of patients and available time slots for doctors, design an algorithm to schedule appointments optimally (minimize waiting time for patients, while maximizing doctor availability).
