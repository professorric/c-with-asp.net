5 Door Challenge 
The 5 Door Challenge is a simulation problem where a set of 5 doors is toggled multiple times based on a set of passes. Initially, all the doors are closed. In each pass, specific doors are toggled (opened or closed) based on the pass number. After completing all the passes, the doors that have been toggled an odd number of times will be open, while the doors toggled an even number of times will remain closed.

In this challenge:
•	Pass 1 toggles every door.
•	Pass 2 toggles every second door.
•	Pass 3 toggles every third door, and so on.
•	The challenge concludes after 5 passes, showing which doors remain open.


Example Output
After 5 passes on 5 doors, the states of the doors will change as follows:

Door Number	Pass 1	Pass 2	Pass 3	Pass 4	Pass 5
Door 1	Open	Open	Open	Open	Open
Door 2	Open	Closed	Closed	Closed	Closed
Door 3	Open	Open	Closed	Closed	Open
Door 4	Open	Open	Open	Closed	Closed
Door 5	Open	Open	Open	Open	Closed
