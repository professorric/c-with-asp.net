5 Door Challenge 
The 5 Door Challenge is a simulation problem where a set of 5 doors is toggled multiple times based on a set of passes. Initially, all the doors are closed. In each pass, specific doors are toggled (opened or closed) based on the pass number. After completing all the passes, the doors that have been toggled an odd number of times will be open, while the doors toggled an even number of times will remain closed.

In this challenge:
•	Pass 1 toggles every door.
•	Pass 2 toggles every second door.
•	Pass 3 toggles every third door, and so on.
•	The challenge concludes after 5 passes, showing which doors remain open.


Example Output
After 5 passes on 5 doors, the states of the doors will change as follows:


Door Number	Pass 1	     Pass 2	     Pass 3	     Pass 4	     Pass 5
Door 1	        Open	      Open	     Open	     Open	     Open
Door 2	        Open	      Closed	     Closed	     Closed	     Closed
Door 3	        Open	      Open	     Closed	     Closed	     Open
Door 4	        Open	      Open	     Open	     Closed	     Closed
Door 5	        Open	      Open	     Open	     Open	     Closed



Explanation:
•	Pass 1: All doors are toggled to open.
•	Pass 2: Every second door is toggled (doors 2 and 4 are toggled).
•	Pass 3: Every third door is toggled (door 3 is toggled).
•	Pass 4: Every fourth door is toggled (door 4 is toggled).
•	Pass 5: Every fifth door is toggled (door 5 is toggled).

At the end, the doors that have been toggled an odd number of times will remain open, and those toggled an even number of times will remain closed.
