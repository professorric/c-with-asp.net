                                                        Namespace Declaration


1. namespace _20doorchallenge.Models
Purpose: This declares the namespace for the Door class.
Explanation:
A namespace is a container for classes and other types, helping organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
_20doorchallenge.Models suggests this is part of the 20doorchallenge project and specifically contains 
models (data structures) used in the application.

    
                                                        Class Declaration
                                                        
2. public class Door
Purpose: Defines a public class named Door.
Explanation:
public means this class can be accessed from other parts of the application.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Here, it represents a "door" with specific properties.

    
                                                       Property: IsOpen
                                                       
3. public bool IsOpen { get; set; }
Purpose: Represents whether the door is open or closed.
Explanation:
public means this property can be accessed and modified from outside the class.
bool is a data type that can only hold two values: true or false.
{ get; set; } makes this property both readable (get) and writable (set).
This property stores the state of the door:
true means the door is open.
false means the door is closed.

    
                                                        Property: State

                                                        
4. public string State { get; set; } = "close";
Purpose: Represents the string representation of the door's state, either "open" or "close".
Explanation:
public makes this property accessible outside the class.
string is a data type used to store text.
{ get; set; } allows the property to be both read and written.
= "close"; initializes the property with a default value of "close".
This ensures that every new Door object starts with the state "close", indicating the door is closed by default.
